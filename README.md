- 👋 Hi, I’m @rjaguado
- 👀 I’m a Chemical Engineering playing Carbohydrate Chemistry.
- 🌱 I’m currently pretending that I understand the density functional theory.
- 💞️ I'm interested in educational resources, polysaccharides, Pickering emulsions, nitroexplosive detection, computational chemistry, simulation of industrial processes, LCA, and beating the latest Zelda.
